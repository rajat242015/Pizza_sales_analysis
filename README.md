🚀 SQL Pizza Sales Analysis Project — Completed! 🍕📊

I’m excited to share my latest SQL project where I analyzed pizza sales data to uncover meaningful business insights using SQL queries.

In this project, I wrote queries across basic, intermediate, and advanced levels to answer key business questions, including:

👉 Total number of orders and total revenue generated
👉 Most common pizza size and highest-priced pizza
👉 Top 5 most ordered pizza types and category-wise total quantities
👉 Order distribution by hour and average pizzas per day
👉 Top 3 pizza types by revenue overall and within each category
👉 Percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue
👉 Cumulative revenue trends over time

This project helped me strengthen my skills in SQL joins, aggregations, time-based analysis, subqueries, and analytical problem solving — all essential for real-world data work.

🛠 Tools used: MySQL / SQL queries
